# concurrent-web-crawler
Web crawler and indexer using parallel processing.

Three crawlers having different functioning have been analysed for the project. The most optimised version is a hybrid of the other two crawlers. The configurations are as follows:

1. Serial Crawler and Indexer - SCSI - serial_crawler.py
2. Concurrent Crawler and Indexer - CCCI - concurrent_crawler.py
3. Concurrent Crawler with Serial Indexer - CCSI - hybrid_crawler.py

The third version - "Concurrent Crawler with serial Indexer", shows the most optimum results when tested.
